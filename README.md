#Installation:
Run setup.sh


This will cause it to automatically start with your computer. You can control
it with `/etc/init.d/cjdns <start|stop|restart|upgrade>`. Some systems (Ubuntu,
not sure about others) allow you to use the `service` command, which shortens
the command to `service cjdns <start|stop|restart|upgrade>`.
